# The NAME is used in project exports and for the target name.
#
# The PATH defines where includes are installed within the installed include
# tree, which should be the path that will be used for actually including
# the files in a source file (i.e. "#include <foo/bar/bla.h>" => "foo/bar").
#
# HEADERS is a list of all public header files for the library.
#
# Unless the library is header-only, SOURCES must be a list of source files.
#
# DEPENDS can be used to reference libraries that are defined
# within this project or another cmake project.
#
# EXTERNS can be used to reference libraries that are defined
# outside the project (i.e. by a find package or pkg-config).
#
# TESTS is a list of tests using a certain old A+C naming scheme.
#
# The flag HEADER_ONLY must be given for guess what.
#
# DONT_INSTALL can be used to prevent installation of this library.
# Libraries used only for testing should get this flag.
