/** The "Station" protokoll is a simple UDP-based broadcast protocol that basically performs
fragmentation and defragmentation of messages that do not fit into a single UDP packet.
It is intended for use in local area networks within one broadcast range.

The protocol is called "station" because it acts like a radio broadcast station. Every station can
broadcast, and the broadcast is picked up by all listening stations.

In addition to fragmentation/defragmentation, the protocol offers two additional features:

1) A transparent 32-Bit Network id that allows to create pseudo-multicast groups
2) Compression of the payload when the uncompressed payload does not fit into one packet

The protocol is not designed for high throughput, but for low-latency and synchronisation purposes.
It also features extensive error checking and reporting. When one packet of a multi-packet message
is lost, the whole message is discarded, no retransmission occurs. Message boundaries are always
preserved. Duplicate messages are not discarded, and nothing is done to ensure ordering of messages,
although on a LAN the ordering of messages is generally preserved. However, message integrity is
strictly preserved.

With 2008 machines and gigabit ethernet, maximum throughput will be in the range of 10-30 MBytes/sec.

Usage:

The interface is quite simple: it consists of the openStation(), closeStation(), broadcast() and receive() calls.

broadcast() takes a block of memory as sole argument and broadcasts it.
receive() is non-blocking and returns the oldest fully received message when available, together with the 
originating host adress and station id.

Caveeats: 
Altough the protocol is fairly simple and easy to use, there are a few things to consider:
1) Under Linux, unfortunately the SO_REUSEPORT socket option does not exist, which limits the number of
receiving stations with the same port number on a single linux host to one. Although this can be solved
by using a simple port forwarder, it is not nice. In practice it is often desirable that multiple
independent processes can listen to the same broadcast.

Please note that you can always provide different port numbers for sending and receiving, so there is
no limit for the number of transmit-only stations on a single Linux host when they use different
port numbers.

On Windows and OSX however however multiple port bindings are allowed. (Windows does not have the
SO_REUSEPORT option, but allowing multiple port bindings is default.)

The proper solution for Linux systems would be to use multicast instead of broadcast. In this case,
the SO_REUSEADDR option hase the same effect like SO_REUSEPORT and should work also properly
with Linux.

2) Currently the protocol adds 40 Bytes overhead, which could be easily reduced to less than the half,
but has not be considered to be worth the problems it might add.

3) The protocol will not perform well when packet loss is high and the messages are very long; the
chances of getting even one message through drops exponentially with the message length:
prob_msg_lost = prob_packet_lost ^ packets_per_message 

4) The implementation is non-blocking and well suited to run in a single threaded environment; therefore
receive() should not be called in a tight loop when there is no work to be performed. A typical usage is
to check once per frame for new messages that have arrived. For operation in a multi-threaded environment,
the code either needs to be modified to support blocking operation as well, or support for using select()
needs to be added; exposing the file descriptor should be enough to do that.
