<!--* N.B. some readers (notably JC) find the following
paragraph awkward and redundant.  I agree it's logically redundant:
it *says* it is summarizing the logical implications of
matching the grammar, and that means by definition it's
logically redundant.  I don't think it's rhetorically
redundant or unnecessary, though, so I'm keeping it.  It
could however use some recasting when the editors are feeling
stronger. -MSM *-->
